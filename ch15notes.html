            <h2>Introduction to Probability</h2>
            <p>
                Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood or chance of events occurring. This chapter introduces key concepts in probability, including experimental probability, theoretical probability, events, outcomes, and more.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Concepts in Probability</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Experiment</strong>: An action or process that leads to a single outcome (e.g., tossing a coin, rolling a die).</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome</strong>: A possible result of an experiment (e.g., heads or tails for a coin toss).</li>
                <li><strong>Event</strong>: A set of outcomes for an experiment (e.g., getting an even number when rolling a die).</li>
                <li><strong>Sample Space</strong>: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment (e.g., the outcomes for rolling a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).</li>
                <li><strong>Probability of an Event</strong>: The likelihood of an event occurring, calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes in the sample space.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Probability</h2>
            <h3>Theoretical Probability</h3>
            <p>Theoretical probability is based on the assumption that all outcomes are equally likely. It is calculated using the formula:</p>
            <pre>Probability (P) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)</pre>

            <h3>Experimental Probability</h3>
            <p>Experimental probability is based on actual experiments or observations. It is calculated by dividing the number of times an event occurs by the total number of trials:</p>
            <pre>Experimental Probability (P) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of trials)</pre>

            <h3>Complementary Events</h3>
            <p>Complementary events are events that cannot happen at the same time. The sum of the probabilities of an event and its complement is always 1.</p>
            <pre>P(A') = 1 - P(A)</pre>
            where P(A') is the probability of the complement of event A.

            <h2>Compound Events</h2>
            <p>Compound events involve two or more simple events. These can be categorized into two types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Independent Events</strong>: The outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of another event.</li>
                <li><strong>Dependent Events</strong>: The outcome of one event affects the outcome of another event.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Addition and Multiplication Rules</h2>
            <h3>Addition Rule</h3>
            <p>The addition rule states that the probability of the union of two events is the sum of the probabilities of the events, minus the probability of their intersection:</p>
            <pre>P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)</pre>

            <h3>Multiplication Rule</h3>
            <p>The multiplication rule states that the probability of the intersection of two events is the product of the probabilities of the individual events:</p>
            <pre>P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)</pre>
            This rule is used for independent events.

            <h2>Examples of Probability</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tossing a Coin:</strong> The probability of getting heads is 1/2, and the probability of getting tails is 1/2.</li>
                <li><strong>Rolling a Die:</strong> The probability of rolling a 3 is 1/6, as there are 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).</li>
                <li><strong>Drawing a Card:</strong> The probability of drawing an Ace from a standard deck of 52 cards is 4/52 (since there are 4 Aces in the deck).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Real-Life Applications of Probability</h2>
            <p>Probability is used in various fields to make predictions and decisions based on uncertain information. Some applications include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weather Forecasting</strong>: Meteorologists use probability to predict the likelihood of weather events, such as rain or snow.</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance</strong>: Insurance companies use probability to calculate risks and set premiums based on the likelihood of certain events happening.</li>
                <li><strong>Games of Chance</strong>: Probability is used to calculate the odds of winning in games like poker, roulette, and lotteries.</li>
                <li><strong>Quality Control</strong>: In manufacturing, probability is used to assess the likelihood of defects in products and to implement quality control measures.</li>
            </ul>
